## How it's going to work ?

#### Routes

Each method will have it's own individual route, such as:
* Add todo
* Remove todo
* Update todo
* See the list of all ToDo's 
* **Login and Register**

#### Multiple users

The program will have a login scheme.
It will allow multiple users to login, and see it's own ToDO's.
It will have a login route as well.

#### Database

The program will have one database, two tables:

1. Users table
2. ToDO's table

The tables are technically relational, but let's create individual ones.

#### Login and Register

It will have the same basic login / register kind of system.
It will store the encrypted password.
